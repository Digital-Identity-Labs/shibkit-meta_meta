## The information in this list is provided for convenience during development.
## It is not, and *cannot*, be guaranteed to be accurate or up-to-date.
## Do not rely on this information as-is for production services.
##
## Some processes should not always be automated.
##
## The correct way to validate metadata is to download the federation certificate
## and verify it 'out of band', by telephone, signed email, or even by post. 
## DNS and even federation sites can be compromised or intercepted; if you 
## can't trust the certificate you can't trust the metadata.
## 

## This file contains metadata about federation metadata and simpler collections
##Â of metadata. It can be used to quickly populate your software with data on
## SAML SPs and IDPs, run tests, or whatever else takes your fancy.

## Please feel free to fork this project on Github, add new federation info,
## then send a pull request!
